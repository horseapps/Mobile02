## SnapJS Mobile 2.0

The SnapJS 2.0 uses Ionic 2+. Some things to keep in mind when using this seed project:

* Use the `src/app/pages/company` as examples of good [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)
* Reference the [SnapMobile Team Wiki](https://github.com/SnapMobileIO/team-wiki) for code, API, review, and team standards
* More reference specific to Ionic in [the Ionic docs](https://ionicframework.com/docs/)

#### Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

Then run: 

```bash
$ ionic serve
```

This should open your browser to `http://localhost:8100` where you will see a running app.
